I am a engineering Apprentice for Bloomberg L.P who strives to create a career in becoming a software engineer/developer. I have expereince with some the of langauges such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Rapid. I began my coding journy when I joined a Web Devlopment class in my freshman year of highschool that I stil am taking going into the senoir year of highschool, at first I thought coding was time consuming and very confusing but as time went one I started to enjoy leanring and understanding how websties and software work that I use everyday. Over time I started making projects that greatly helped me become more aligned with coding, I even created a project to website to make concepts for a game that I play and hopefully would add more in the future.
